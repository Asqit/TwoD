# TwoD
*tiny javascript library*

TwoD.js is my tiny javascript library for easing my work with `HTML5CanvasElement` while making interactive applications. It served me mostly for making my javascript games.

## Contents: 
namespace is TwoD. So when you need to use some part of the lib, you simply call it by `TwoD` + dot notation.

* `Frame` - canvas class
* `Math` - Object with mathematics 
* `Perf` - object for calculating FPS and delta time
* `Shapes` (Vec2, Circle, Rect, Line...)
* `Collision` (measures collision between shapes)

**more to come** 

## how to use
Its very simple.

1. clone it or download `TwoD.mjs`
2. extract/move to desired location
3. import TwoD object `import { TwoD } from "./location/to/TwoD.mjs"` 
4. Voila! It should be working (to test this out, open console `F12` and go to console, there you should see colored text)

## What can it do ? 

TwoD can make multiple canvases, help you with some basic math and measure performance, collision. I will be adding more stuff with some time, this is all for now.
