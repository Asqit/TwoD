# TwoD
*tiny javascript library*

TwoD.js is my tiny javascript library for easing my work with HTML5CanvasElement while making interactive applications. IT served me mostly for making my javascript games.

## Contents: 

1. TwoD.mjs - core of the library
2. Keyboard.mjs - my keyboard events

## how to use
Its very simple, just use `import { TwoD } from "./location/to/TwoD.mjs"` and thats it.

## What can it do ? 

TwoD can make multiple canvases, help you with some basic math and measure performance, collision. I will be adding more stuff with some time, this is all for now.
