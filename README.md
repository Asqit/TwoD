# TwoD
*tiny javascript library*

TwoD.js is my tiny javascript library for easing my work with HTML5CanvasElement while making interactive applications. IT served me mostly for making my javascript games.

## Contents: 

* Frame - canvas class
* Math - Object with mathematics 
* Perf - object for calculating FPS and delta time
* Shapes (Vec2, Circle, Rect, Line...)
* Collision (measures collision between shapes)

**more to come** 

## how to use
Its very simple.

1. clone it or download `TwoD.mjs`
2. extract/move to desired location
3. import TwoD module `import { TwoD } from "./location/to/TwoD.mjs"` 
4. Voila! It should be working (to test this out, try `console.log(TwoD.Math.rand(0, 100))` it should return random number from 0 to 100)

## What can it do ? 

TwoD can make multiple canvases, help you with some basic math and measure performance, collision. I will be adding more stuff with some time, this is all for now.
